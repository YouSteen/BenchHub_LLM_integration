## 🔄 Application Flow – Visual Guide

### 🔹 Step 1 – Microsoft Forms Survey

➡️ ![Step 1 – Survey](flow/survey.png)

Employees fill out a Microsoft Form with office location, learning goals, and upskilling preferences.

### 🔹 Step 2 – Excel File Synced via OneDrive

➡️ ![Step 2 – Excel](flow/excel.png)

Responses are saved in a `.xlsx` file and automatically synced locally via OneDrive. This file is parsed by the application.

---

### 🔹 Step 3 – Console UI Interaction

➡️ ![Step 3 – CLI UI](flow/ui.png)

A terminal-based interface allows:

- Running the email generator
- Configuring OneDrive paths and CC emails
- Previewing survey entries
- Exiting the app

### 🔹 Step 4 – LLM-Powered Email Generation

➡️ ![Step 4 – Email](flow/email.png)

The application:

- Extracts 3 key answers per user
- Passes them into a prompt
- Sends the prompt to the **Mistral LLM**
- Wraps the generated message into a personalized Outlook email

### 🔹 Step 5 – Delivery Log Tracking

➡️ ![Step 5 – Log](flow/sent_log.png)

Each email (sent or failed) is tracked in `sent_log.xlsx` with:

- Timestamp
- Status (Success / Error)
- Details for debugging if needed
